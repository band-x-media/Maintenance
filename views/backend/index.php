<h1>Maintenance Manager</h1>

<p>This plugin is written to prevent site wide access to a Wolf website when it is in "Maintenance Mode".</p>

<p>When a client requests a page, we check if the site is in Maintenance Mode or not and decide what to display.</p>

<p>When in Maintenance Mode you can set up this plugin to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- Redirect to an allowed page on your site, or to an external site</li>
	<li>- Display a defined set of content, which you can edit in this plugins admin section</li>
</ul>

<p>You can allow IP addresses through the block and attach names and notes to each IP so you can easily see who is able to access the site.</p>
